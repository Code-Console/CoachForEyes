    'WPM, meaning words per minute, is a measure of typing speed. For the purposes of WPM measurement a word is standardized to five characters or keystrokes. Therefore, brown counts as one word, but accounted counts as two. The benefits of a standardized measurement of input speed are that it enables comparison across language and hardware boundaries. The speed of an Afrikaans speaking operator in Cape Town can be compared with a French speaking operator in Paris.',

    'There are many idiosyncratic typing styles in between novice-style "hunt and peck" and touch typing. For example, many "hunt and peck" typists have the keyboard layout memorized and are able to type while focusing their gaze on the screen. Some use just two fingers, while others use three to six fingers. Some use their fingers very consistently, with the same finger being used to type the same character every time, while others vary the way they use their fingers. Some people combine touch typing and hunt and peck by using a buffering method. In the buffer method, the typist looks at the source copy, mentally stores one or several sentences, and then looks at the keyboard and types out the buffer of sentences. This eliminates frequent up and down motions with the head and is used in typing competitions in which the typist is not well versed in touch typing. Not normally used in day-to-day contact with keyboards, this buffer method is used only when time is of the essence. ',
    'December 17, 1903, is the birth date of all airplanes. Orville and Wilbur Wright started building gliders in 1900. In 1903, they built a motor and propeller for their glider. Orville ' +
    'made the first flight, which lasted 12 seconds, and flew 120 feet. Wilbur\'s flight was 852 feet in 59 seconds. These first flights in 1903 were just the start of the evolution of planes.' +
    'By the year 1909, Bleriot had crossed the English Channel. By the year 1912, a two-piece plywood fuselage was built for greater strength. By the 1930s, the all-metal fuselage was tried, ' +
    'and it soon appeared in DC3s. From the Wrights\' 1903 motor and prop came the engines for the 1950 turbojet that generated at least 19,600 pounds of thrust. The big Boeing 747 has four ' +
    'engines with 50,000 pounds of thrust each. The future holds an advanced super-sonic jet with a saving of almost 40 percent in fuel usage.'
